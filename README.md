# Project-1 - Google Play Store Analysis

**Context**

While many public datasets (on Kaggle and the like) provide Apple App Store data, there are not many counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web. On digging deeper, I found out that iTunes App Store page deploys a nicely indexed appendix-like structure to allow for simple and easy web scraping. On the other hand, Google Play Store uses sophisticated modern-day techniques (like dynamic page load) using JQuery making scraping more challenging.

**Data Source**

The source of raw data was found in (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps), which has crucial information in categories such as, category of data, price, reviews, size, version, last updated, and content rating.  The original CSV file contained over 10 000 data entries. 

**Objective**
This project focuses on data cleaning and analysis of apps from the Google Play Store, to understand their relationships with one another.
